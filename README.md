# Renewable Energy & Solar Compliance Insights

## 1. Business Context

The transition to decentralised reneable energy has fundamentally disrupted the traditional one-way electricity distribution model. In high-penetration markets, the rapid scaling rooftop solar has introduced non-linear two-way power flows, creating significant challenges for voltafe stability and network reliability. 

Traditionally, distirbution networks were built for predictable, centralised delivery; today, they function as complex, bi-directional ecosystems. This evolution has intorduced systemic complian risks, specifically volatfe breaches and thermal constraints, that vary significantly across diverse regional demographics and installation profiles. Managing these emerging risks at scale requires a shift form reactive maintenance to proactice, data-driven forecasting. By leveraging advance analytics to predict compliance failures before they occure, we aim to ensure grid safety while maximising the integration of renewable assets, to which is a critical requirement for the modern energy landscape.

## 3. Analytical Sub-Questions

To address the core business question, the analysis focuses on the following
supporting questions:

1. **How has rooftop solar adoption changed over time and across regions?**  
   Understanding growth patterns and concentrations of solar installations
   provides context for where network pressures are increasing.

2. **How do solar compliance outcomes vary by region and installation profile?**  
   Identifying differences in compliance performance helps surface areas
   where risk may be elevated or emerging.
3. **Are there observable patterns of repeat or clustered non-compliance?**  
   Examining whether certain issues recur or cluster geographically can
   indicate systemic risk rather than isolated failures.

4. **Which factors are most strongly associated with elevated compliance risk?**  
   Analysing historical data to understand which variables (e.g. growth rate,
   installation characteristics, prior compliance outcomes) are linked to
   higher risk supports targeted intervention.

5. **Can historical compliance and installation data be used to predict
   emerging compliance risk in future periods?**  
   Evaluating whether predictive models can identify areas or profiles likely
   to experience increased non-compliance enables earlier and more proactive
   decision-making.
