# Renewable Energy & Solar Compliance Insights

## 1. Business Context

As a regulated electricity distributor, AusNet is responsible for maintaining the safety,
reliability, and performance of the network while supporting the ongoing transition to
renewable energy. The rapid uptake of rooftop solar has fundamentally changed how
electricity flows through distribution networks and, in turn, how network risks must
be managed.

Traditionally designed for one-way power delivery from central generators to customers,
electricity networks must now accommodate two-way energy flows, as solar customers both
consume electricity and export excess generation back into the grid. This shift increases
the complexity of voltage management, network stability, and safety, particularly as the
number and diversity of solar installations continues to grow.

## 2. Core Business Question

As rooftop solar adoption continues to scale within a two-way electricity network,
can data-driven models be used to predict emerging solar compliance risk across regions
and installation profiles, enabling earlier and more targeted intervention to support
network safety and reliability?
